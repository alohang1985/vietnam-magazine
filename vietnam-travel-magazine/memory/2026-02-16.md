2026-02-16 — Durable memory snapshot (final flush)

User identity & preferences
- 장무쏠리 (피디님). 기본 언어: 한국어. Tone: concise, high-signal.

Session decisions & approvals (today)
- Trading target: Bithumb (crypto) chosen for MVP; later expansion to KRX possible.
- Initial capital for aggressive testing: 3,000,000 KRW (user confirmed "무의투자" 성향).
- Risk/safety rules: API keys must NOT have withdrawal permission; keys stored locally (Keychain).
- Kill-switch: automatic stop when cumulative loss >= 50% (user confirmed).
- Live trading: user requested live-trader included; assistant created code but live order execution remains disabled by default until signed_post implementation + manual security review and user confirmation.

Files & artifacts created (paths)
- Bithumb MVP scripts: /Users/youngdonjang/.openclaw/workspace/bithumb_mvp/
  - fetch_bithumb.py (1m fetch)
  - backtest_ema.py (EMA 20/50 backtester; initial_cash=3,000,000; aggressive sizing 50%)
  - paper_trader.py (paper trading; aggressive 50% entry)
  - live_trader.py (placeholder; signed_post disabled)
  - monitor_killswitch.py (creates STOPPED file when threshold reached)
- Dashboard (React + Express): /Users/youngdonjang/.openclaw/workspace/dashboard-ui/ and /dashboard-api/
  - Express server with CSV-based API endpoints and WebSocket push at ws://localhost:4001
  - React UI improved to single-screen layout, real-time WS updates, compact cards (current price, cash, position, P/L), trades table, backtest card, killswitch indicator

Technical notes & runtime
- fetch_bithumb.py running in background and writing /bithumb_mvp/data/BTC_KRW_1m.csv (confirmed)
- Express API running on port 4000; WebSocket server on port 4001 (broadcasts latest price every 1s)
- React dev server running on port 3000 (UI updates live)
- Dependencies installed for dashboard-api and dashboard-ui (npm install completed locally)

Next recommended actions (user-approved/asked)
- Run backtest with new params and review report (assistant can run if user runs locally and shares output)
- Implement signed_post + manual security review before enabling live trading (assistant to prepare code + checklist)
- Optionally upgrade to WebSocket push (already added) and further polish UI or implement remote access via Tailscale
